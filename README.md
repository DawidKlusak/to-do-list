Hi! This is my second to-do list project. Through this simple application, we can both add tasks and remove them in a simple and transparent way. The application has been formatted and is responsive.

Besides technologies i showed below, i used: BEM, JavaScript ES+6, and normalize.css. That helps me make my project more responisve and clearly.

## Demo

When you write a amout in polish zloty in input and press a beige button "Przelicz" you get how much money you should get in chosen currency.
Keep it simple.
