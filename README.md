Hi! This is my second to-do list project. Through this simple application, we can both add tasks and remove them in a simple and transparent way. The application has been formatted and is responsive.

Besides technologies i showed below, i used: BEM, JavaScript ES+6, and normalize.css. That helps me make my project more responisve and clear.

The application allows you to add tasks in real time. After clicking the green button, the task is considered completed. The red button allows you to delete the task.
